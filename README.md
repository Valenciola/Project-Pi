# Project-Pi
A webdev project. I'm not sure how far it'll take me, but I'd like to see where I can go. Just how much of a game can I make out of a website? Find out soon!

### Where We Are Now
Right now, all you'll see when you access the website is the curtain page, which I'm using to display current status of the project, as  well as doing a bit of small testing (for example, how to get the music to loop right).

### What's Next
Hopefully next time you'll see some logic implemented and maybe even a few character designs (if you know where to look).
